The 64 bit kernel has no support for omxplayer or checking the cpu temp as
needed depends has not been ported over. This kernel works fine for streaming
to the lan with updateDVB either from the rpi desktop or via ssh -Y.

You can however use VC4 hardware decoding and mpv which will be similar to using
mpv compiled with MMAL. You will be limited to the stream bitrate size just like
it is with MMAL. Most atsc streams will play well. The sound coming through the 
hdmi port will be a little off as it is a work in progress. VC4 creates it's
own sound devices.

* To switch back & forth between VC4 and regular on aarch64 on the pi3/pi2b+ *

# To enable VC4
# Disable fbturbo:

sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.~

# Add this to the bottom of /boot/config.txt and modify the gpu_mem as
# aarch64 VC4 has it's own video memory equivalent built in (cma=256).

gpu_mem=16

dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
avoid_warnings=2

## Reboot for all to take effect

# Reverse to revert back to regular:

sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.~ /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf

## Comment out the lines you added at the bottom of /boot/config.txt and restore
## the gpu_mem= valuse to it's original state.

gpu_mem=160

#dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
#avoid_warnings=2

I kind of like the aarch64. The VC4 plays video lots better than with out it.
The sound is a little off thru hdmi as it is a work in progress. VC4 creates it's
own sound devices. Speakers in the headphone jack is supposed to be better.
Omxplayer and cpu temp readings are not supported as of now.

I never play video on my pi's; I only stream and aarch64 is perfect for that.
