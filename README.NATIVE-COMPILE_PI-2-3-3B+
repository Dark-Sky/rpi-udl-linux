******************** NATIVE COMPILE FOR THE RPI KERNEL***********************

THIS WILL UPGRADE THE KERNEL FOR USE WITH OUR ARCH LINUX IMAGE

THIS KERNEL HAS NEW DVB HEADERS. FOLLOW PROCEDURE BELOW TO SANITIZE THE
UAPI HEADERS FOR USER SPACE APPS AND INSTALL THEM AFTER COMPILING/INSTALLING
THE NEW KERNEL

*****************************************************************************

# Current kernel for the RPi 2/3/3B+ is 4.19.0-rc2

# UPDATE:

# UDL HAS ADDED A NEW DEPEND FOR THE KERNEL BUILDING. I DO NOT THINK IT AFFECTS COMPILING ON THE PI
# BUT INSTALL IT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE:

sudo pacman -S pigz

# Adjust gcc stddef.h header path:

# For some reason lately the current gcc header stddef.h is not getting picked up in the system include
# path so we need to make a link so it will be found:

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/gcc/armv7l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/"YOUR-CURRENT-GCC-VERSION"/include/stddef.h /usr/include/linux/stddef.h

# CLONE REPO & COMPILE KERNEL
# Note: If you upgraded to gcc8 there will be several warnings. They are safe to ignore.

git clone https://bitbucket.org/dark-sky/rpi-udl-linux       # Clone repo
cd rpi-udl-linux
make -j4 bcm2709-udl_defconfig                    # Generate .config file
make -j4 menuconfig                               # Save and exit
make -j4                                          # Compile kernel

# INSTALL KERNEL & RELATED FILES TO THE SYSTEM

sudo cp /boot/kernel7.img /boot/kernel7.img-sav   # Back up existing kernel
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/kernel7.img    # Copy new kernel to /boot
sudo make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/usr modules_install   # Installs modules

# INSTALL KERNEL BLOBS TO /BOOT

sudo cp -v arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb /boot
sudo cp -v arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb /boot/
sudo cp -v arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2710-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb /boot/      # New pi3b+ firm

#  INSTALL NEW SANITIZED DVB HEADERS FOR USER SPACE APPS TO SDCARD'S ROOT PARTITION

sudo cp -v sanitized-dvb-headers/* /usr/include/linux/dvb/

# DO NOT SKIP THIS. It seems they have fixed this so reverse it or it will cause problems

Edit the /boot/cmdline.txt and remove these 2 options if you have them in the file:

dwc_otg.fiq_enable=0 dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0

sudo sync

sudo reboot

NOTE:

I DO NOT HAVE A PI 3B+ AND SO IT'S ONBOARD WIFI IS UNTESTED HERE. I INCLUDED THE LATEST
RASPIAN FIRMWARE IN  firmware/brcm/ IN THIS TREE IF NEEDED.

cd firmware
sudo make install
