# THIS KERNEL IS NOW COMPATABLE WITH THE PI 3B+
# THIS KERNEL NOW HAS SUPPORT FOR AARCH64 & VC4 ON THE PI3B/PI3B+

# Current kernel for the RPi 2/3/3B+ is 4.20.0-rc6
Majortom's & DarkSky's repository based off of V4L media_tree,
powARman's saa716x work, and Updatelee's work. With out 
Updatelees's hard work this would not be possible; Thanks UDL!

This is a modified kernel source for use with the Raspberry
Pi 2, 3 & 3B+ that is used in our custom Arch Raspberry Pi image.

This kernel allows for blind scanning and playing higher bitrate
feeds from FTA satellite streams using Updatelee's program 
updateDVB. It is also excellent for ATSC use.

# Tested with:

The usb prof devices should work

Some usb TBS devices work

Skystar 2 eXpress HD

Genpix Skywalker-1

Hauppauge 950Q & 955Q

Some usb InDtube ATSC devices work pretty good

Others are reported working as well.
